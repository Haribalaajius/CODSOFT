            <h2>Education<br><span>Power of Youth!!</span></h2>
            <p>The role of education is inevitable in producing a new generation that can solve real problems in our society. Today, an ever-growing number of people are not satisfied with their basic education and seek secondary or tertiary education to meet the demands of contemporary society. They sacrifice their time, money, and sometimes even their health to raise their educational level because they realize that education is their passport to the future.</p>
            <p>The school can also play a role in supporting youthsâ€™ development toward a positive sense of ethnic identity. For instance, they can organize several programs to build up their sense of interaction among ethnicities and improve their understanding of other ethnic groups. By implementing these programs, students will become more tolerant and respectful of other ethnic groups.</p>
